linguistic-analysis
===================

A simple example of linguistic analysis using pattern library.

DEPENDANCIES:
- pattern library, version used: 2.2
- BeautifulSoup to create the .html results file
- Google graph libraries are used to create the graph displayed in the html

HOW IT WORKS:
The python script gets data using the Twitter API calls offered by pattern, then analyze them using pattern nlp capabilities, and in the end uses BS to create an html page with a chart: the chart is made using the (old) Google charts service

HOW TO USE IT:
Just launch the python file
